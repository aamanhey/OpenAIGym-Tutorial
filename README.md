## Software Documentation
In order to run the code for this project the first step is to install the dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file using

    pip install -r requirements.txt

After the dependencies are installed you will be able to run the main python file for this tutorial __taxi.py__.

    python3 taxi.py

This file houses the code for the brute force and Q-learning implementations.
If one wishes to view only one of the implementations, then all you must do is remove the function calls of the other algorithm.
The __evaluate.py__ file was used to generate the evaluation metrics for both implementations.
